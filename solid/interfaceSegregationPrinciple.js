// The interface segregation principle states that “clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on interfaces that they don’t use.”
// This means that we shouldn’t impose the implementation of something if it’s not needed.
// JavaScript doesn’t have interfaces, so this principle doesn’t apply directly since it doesn’t enforce the implementation of anything via interfaces.
